## Aims and scope

We publish **articles** in all fields related to physics, including theoretical physics, (sub)atomic physics, condensed matter, classical and quantum optics, instrumentation, astrophysics and cosmology, applied mathematics, computational physics, engineering sciences, chemical physics, biophysics, etc.

In particular, we welcome **bibliographic articles written by students** as a way to learn how to write and publish a scientific article. Students are encouraged to take advantage of their internships and projects to write and submit their own articles.

In addition to these articles, we also publish **seminar proceedings** that report the content of various seminars held by QMat students at the Faculty of Physics and Engineering.

## Submission process

To submit an article, please send an email to Maxence Pandini (maxence.pandini @ etu.unistra.fr) briefly explaining the content of the work and containing all requested documents (see below). Submissions are checked for completeness and relevance by the Editorial Board and then single-anonymously peer-reviewed (the reviewers' identity is unknown to the author(s)). The Editorial Board takes a decision on publication upon reception of the reviewers' reports (acceptance, minor changes required, major changes required, refusal). If changes are required, you will be asked to complete a second submission.

## Research data and permissions

Please ensure that you have permission to publish the data and content you use in your article before submission. Notably, if the article results from an internship, ask your tutor to check the content of your article before submitting.
