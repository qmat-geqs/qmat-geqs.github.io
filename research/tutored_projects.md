# Propositions for M1S2 tutored project

M1 students have the possibility to carry out their optional tutored project with the GeQS. The project's subject should respect the guidelines imposed by the Faculty, but within these limits, we allow a great freedom in the subject's choice, and provide a more regular supervision than what full-time researchers are usually able to do.

The subjects specified below are examples rather than an exhaustive list of all possibilities. In accordance with the GeQS' objectives, these subjects are directly research topics, but necessitate a thorough bibliographical search before any research can be undertaken.

In the ideal case, the tutored students would begin their project by this bibliographical search, whose outcome is their oral examination at the end of the semester, and then would carry out the associated research in close collaboration with GeQS members, resulting in the publication of a paper, either in the *Strasbourg Students Physical Letters* if the material is too thin or in a recognized journal if sufficiently interesting new results have been obtained.
