# Propositions for M1S2 tutored project

M1 students have the possibility to carry out their optional tutored project with the GeQS. The project's subject should respect the guidelines imposed by the Faculty, but within these limits, we allow a great freedom in the subject's choice, and provide a more regular supervision than what full-time researchers are usually able to do.

The subjects specified below are examples rather than an exhaustive list of all possibilities. In accordance with the GeQS' objectives, these subjects are directly research topics, but necessitate a thorough bibliographical search before any research can be undertaken.

In the ideal case, the tutored students would begin their project by this bibliographical search, whose outcome is their oral examination at the end of the semester, and then would carry out the associated research in close collaboration with GeQS members, resulting in the publication of a paper, either in the *Strasbourg Students Physical Letters* if the material is too thin or in a recognized journal if sufficiently interesting new results have been obtained.

Please contact [Loris Delafosse](../index.md#contact-us) for any question, or if you are interested in following a tutored project with the GeQS.

All propositions are classified into one or several of the three following classes: (1) biophysics and soft condensed matter; (2) quantum physics, quantum condensed matter and solid state physics; (3) subatomic physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

Your internship and your tutored project cannot belong to the same class. Many of the subjects can be classified into two different classes, changing the colouration of the project.

### Time reversal symmetry

> Possible colourations: quantum physics (2) or high-energy physics (3)

Most microscopic physical processes are symmetric under time reversal. More often than not, irreversibility is an emergent property of large systems, justified by statistical considerations. One the hand, it conceptually satisfactory to imagine that "T-symmetr" should be a fundamental symmetry of nature. On the other hand, how is it compatible with causality? Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, for instance, is not symmetric under time reversal since it only considers electromagnetic waves propagating forward in time (retarded solutions of the d'Alembert equation). The [Wheeler-Feynman absorber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeler%E2%80%93Feynman_absorber_theory) symmetrizes the theory by also taking into account the waves propagating *backward* in time (advanced solutions of the d'Alembert equation). Remarkably, the advanced waves can be "recast" in terms of retarded waves, making the absorber theory equivalent to Maxwell's theory, and so T-symmetry can be reconciled with causality.

What happens if we try to describe other fields (electrons, for instance) with this kind of symmetric formalism? Can the backward waves be interpreted as antiparticles? Can we recast these antiparticles in terms of particles? The absorber theory also strongly inspired the [transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_interpretation) where retarded and advanced wavefunctions are considered. Again, can these advanced wavefunctions be interpreted as antiparticles?

T-symmetry is however not a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model, since it is violated by weak interaction. Why? How? And since it is not possible to effectively *reverse time* in a laboratory, how can we measure T-symmetry violation?

### Applications of the Bohr-Sommerfeld semi-classical theory

> Possible colourations: quantum physics (2), high-energy physics (3) or cosmology (3)

Semi-classical methods yield astonishingly good results for a number of useful systems and can deepen our understanding of Quantum Mechanics. Among the most notorious semi-classical quantization schemes, we can cite the [Bohr-Sommerfeld rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory) which, despite its mathematical simplicity, correctly describes the energy gaps of the infinite well, the harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, etc. Is it possible to apply the Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to more complicated systems, are what are its limits? Can we describe electron correlations in chemical systems? light-matter couplings? quantum chromodynamics? quantum gravity?

### The ADM formalism of General relativity and its connection to twistor theory

> Colouration: cosmology (3)

The [ADM formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM_formalism) is a formulation of General Relativity (GR) in which spacetime is sliced into space-like hypersurfaces, reintroducing a clear separation between "space" (the hypersurfaces) and "time" (a parameter describing a sequence of space-like hypersurfaces). There seems to be a deep connection between this point of view and [twistor theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory), a (now largely abandoned) program proposed by Roger Penrose a few decades ago that describes spacetime not as a set of *events*, but as being generated by the light rays. Light rays are themselves described as twistors, objects composed of two spinors, thus formulating GR in a language shared by Quantum Mechanics. For a while, physicists hoped twistors could be the key to Quantum Gravity, but the program never came to fruition. Twistor theory is nevertheless still used nowadays, in string theory for example, as it facilitates some mathematical derivations.
