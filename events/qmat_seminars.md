# QMat Seminars

The QMat Seminars are courses organized by [QMat](https://qmat.unistra.fr/) students at the Faculty of Physics and Engineering, in partnership with the Tutoring Division of the [ARIANE](https://www.asso-ariane.fr/), the [Strasbourg Students Physical Letters](https://2spl.odoo.com/) and the GeQS research group.

QMat Seminars are courses intended to foster a better understanding of theoretical aspects of quantum sciences among physics students. All seminars are held at the _Institut de Physique_ in Strasbourg, and the proceedings are published in the _Strasbourg Students Physical Letters_ ([here](https://2spl.odoo.com/seminars)).

## 2024-2025 First Semester

### 27.09 (16h-17h30): Tensor calculus for physicists

  > Target audience: L3-M1
  > 
  > Fresnel Amphitheater

Tensors are quite general mathematical objects, used in almost all areas of physics, from continuum mechanics to general relativity and quantum physics. Beginning with a reminder of some useful concepts of linear algebra, this seminar introduces the notion of tensor, discusses its relation with metrics, covariance and contravariance in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, and eventually presents tensor products in the context of quantum mechanics.

### 15.10 (14h-16h): Elements of classical field theory

  > Target audience: M1-M2
  > 
  > Fresnel Amphitheater

Classical field theory is the branch of mathematical physics dealing with non-quantized fields as representations of physical objects. The first historical motivation for using fields was of course Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism,which revealed how powerful this kind of formalism might be. This seminar first introduces the mathematical notion of field, and how it can be connected to physics through Lagrangians. The consequences of field symmetries are investigated, beginning with Noether's theorem and leading to the idea of gauge fields and covariant derivatives as the best mathematical description of fundamental interactions. The relation of _classical_ field theory with relativistic quantum mechanics and general relativity is (briefly) discussed, although no previous knowledge of these domains is assumed.

### 02.12 (10h-12h): Construction of the quantum state space

  > Target audience: L3-M2
  > 
  > Room 103

The first postulate of Quantum Mechanics asserts that a system's state is completely characterized by some vector, element of an abstract space called the *state space*. The features of this space may vary considerably from one system to another, and even for simple systems, the physical interpretation of the state vectors is not always straightforward. This seminar aims at elaborating a rigorous, step-by-step, construction of the state space associated to *real space variables*, first for systems with 1 degree of freedom (one particle evolving in one dimension), and then for 3D and many-body systems. The state space associated to *spin variables* is introduced in a second part, allowing us to discuss the notions of quantum entanglement and indiscernability.

## 2024-2025 Second semester (yet to come)

Seminar subjects should include:

- Symmetries and representation theory in high-energy physics
- Path integrals in quantum mechanics, statistical physics and quantum field theory: physical interpretation and mathematical aspects (probably 2 or 3 seminars)
- Classical field theory: towards quantization and general relativity
