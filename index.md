# Geometry for Quantum Science

Welcome on the GeQS website!

The Geometry for Quantum Science (GeQS) research group is a student project based at the University of Strasbourg, and organized around the [Faculty of Physics and Engineering](https://physique-ingenierie.unistra.fr/) and the [Quantum Science and Nanomaterials (QMat)](https://qmat.unistra.fr/) Interdisciplinary Thematic Institute.

Our goal is to strengthen **training through research** in fields like quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and high energy physics, and to promote the teaching of **theoretical** and **mathematical physics** through the organization of student semainars, tutoring sessions (with the Tutoring Division of the ARIANE, the Faculty's student association) and through the publication of a QMat journal.

We are conducting our own research in these fields, with the aim of developing formal and numerical tools for fundamental and educational physics. Current research topics include clifford algebras, twistor theory, semi-classical models and applied category theory.

## Who are we?

### Romain Beauclaire
> *Student in mathematics, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Strasbourg.*

Highly interested in applied mathematics, Romain helps us tackle mathematical issues within the framework we are elaborating. He's currently working on screw differential calculus.

### Simon Beaudoin
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Mainly interested in subatomic and high energy physics, Simon shares with us his helpful experience in quantum field theory. (He also has Feynman's face on his sockets.)

### Loris Delafosse
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Seeking to obtain new geometrical insight into known physical phenomena, Loris is responsible for the early developments of the generalized screw formalism.

### Amr Hussein
> *Student in fundamental physics, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Always eager to find geometrical meaning in physical theories, Amr raises useful new questions and interpretations. He's currently working on twistor theory.

### Maxence Pandini
> *Student in fundamental physics and QMat member, Faculty of Physics and Engineering, University of Strasbourg.*

Namely interested in statiscal and quantum mechanics, Maxence helps us carrying out lengthy calculations that arise in Geometric Algebra. (Also, don't mention polymers when you're talking to him.)

### Antoine Royer
> *Student in oceanography, atmospheric physics and climatology and TESS member, Faculty of Sciences and Engineering, University of Toulouse III (Paul Sabatier).*

As the group's computer technician, Antoine develops new computational tools supporting our theoretical research.
